# conformal_efficiency


Calibration and uncertainty metrics used in the study of the applicability domain in federated multitask learning. 

The two Jupyter Notebooks provide examples on code usage for Conformal Prediction and Platt scaling. The code on Conformal Prediction is based on the implementation from https://github.com/ptocca.
